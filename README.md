# FuzzyLogic

Learning Fuzzy Logic

ChatGPT wrote most of this code.  This is just meant as an example of Fuzzy Logic.

## Files

### fuzzy_logic.py

This file contains the actual implementation of the fuzzy logic.
Try changing around the temperature to see different resulting outputs.

### fuzzy_logic_graph.py

This file contains a graph of the fuzzy membership functions.
This graph should help visualize how the fuzzy logic determines how hot or cold the temperature is.
Try changing around the MIN and MAX constants to see how that changes the graph.
